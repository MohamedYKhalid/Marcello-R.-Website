Dark theme would be best. Dark theme like a dark grey for background, turquoise blue for the main text and plain white for regular text. like my name (it feels too narcissistic to have my name on big letters, but i do it because i really need the work) and the contact, about on bold letters and on turquoise. then the rest of the text plain white.
